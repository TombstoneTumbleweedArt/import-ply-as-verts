<strong>Blender 3.1 Alpha (and later) PLY Importer: Complete drop-in replacement for the stock Blender PLY import module.</strong>
Correctly loads vertex-colored point clouds and nonstandard PLY files that the original importer wasn't meant for.
Retains all the functionality of the original codebase.
